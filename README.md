# Sciantia-AI
Sciantia AI is a tool that enables you to ask questions directly to YouTube videos using the advanced capabilities of OpenAI’s LLM. Sciantia AI is designed to provide an intuitive assistant that has access to the entire video transcript regardless of the transcript size(the relevant parts of the transcript is fed to the llm depending on the user’s question using OpenAI’s embedding models), augmented by a powerful search engine that allows the model to search the internet for additional information if needed.
